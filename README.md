# resin-mdns-service

An example project to set up a local service and advertise it over Avahi/mDNS.
We create a "Quote of the Day" service exposed on port 17, and adverise it over
Avahi.

See more examples of Avahi services in the [ArchLinux Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/avahi#Adding_services).
